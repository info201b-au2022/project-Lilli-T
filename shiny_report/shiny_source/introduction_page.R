  ### Problem domain: 
  
  As residences in the Pacific Northwest, the increasing rate and intensity of annual wildfires has been a recurring and devastating concern for the local human and animal population. 
  Wildfires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that continue to warm the planet. 
  They damage forests tthat would otherwise remove CO2 from the air. They also emit soot and other aerosols into the atmosphere, with complex effects on global warming 
  and cooling. The air pollution that came along with wildfires poses serious threats to community members health, because it can be a direct cause for a range of health issues such as respiratory problems, transient reductions in lung function, 
  and pulmonary inflammation. Investigating this issue is of great importance to our group. We aimed to create a report that's location and personal-health oriented, and 
  is informative in ways that help commmunity members understand the indoor protections they have access to against wildfires, reexamine their cautiousness of the wildefires and assess the threat they face based on their geographic locations. 
  

  ### Our 4 research questions: 
  
  1. Does the general health of a survey participant affect their consciousness of the negative health effects of wildfires? This is a question to expose possible disparities between the health concerns of a generally healthy individual versus a generally unhealthy individual. Knowledge of this encourages building planners to consider the accessibility of the shelters available.
  2. Does the geographic location of a survey participant affect their perception of wildfires? This question explores how an individualâ€™s analysis of perceived danger correlates to their daily surroundings. Data analysts must be aware that a survey respondent answers in the context of their daily life, so answers are affected by intersectionality.
  3. Which rooms do people imagine to be the safest during an increase in air pollutants due to wildfire smoke? This question is crucial to understanding possible reasons for taking shelter in certain areas, and this more clearly defines the meaning of safety as the mix between emotional and physical safety.
  4. Which rooms have the best measured air quality during an increase in wildfire smoke? This question allows for a comparison between perceived safety and scientific safety, as measured by the amount of pollutants in the air. Building planners can use this data to create spaces that both protect against pollutants and are an inviting environment.
  
  ### Data analyzation: 
  
  To perform our analysis, we examined 3 sets of data: a study on indoor room pollution in buildings in UC Berkeley done by UC Berkeley researchers,  a wildfire record that came from the US Forest Service, 
  and a participants response survey regarding the 2018 California wildfires. We chose these 3 data sets to precisely address the questions we aim to answer above. 
  
  
  ### Key findings 

  We found that 
  
  * In terms of human activity during wildfires, most people who identify as in good health or excellent health chose to stay home, and those who identify as in fair health and poor health reported to have taken medications. 
  * People tend not to choose indoor shelters based on the rooms air quality index during wildfires, some of the safest rooms were the least used. 
  * People have clear gravitations towards some rooms consistantly over the others. This could potentially be a result of lack of statistical information, personal convenience or job duty.
