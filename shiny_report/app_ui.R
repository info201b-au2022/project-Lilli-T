    population in the greater Boise area react to protect themselves about 
    wildfire smoke. The majority of respondents ranked themselves as either in 
    good health or excellent health. This chart demonstrates that staying 
    at home was the most common course of action for those in excellent and good 
    health. However, those in poor and fair health reported that taking 
    medications was the most common action. Additionally, those in good healthâ€™s 
    third most popular action was to use a personal air filter. Moving to a 
    building with an air filter was the third, and fifth choice for those in 
    fair and good health, respectively.")
