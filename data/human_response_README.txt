            <abstract>This dataset consists of in-person and online survey of 
            the public. We conducted a survey among 614 people in different areas of the Boise 
            Metropolitan Area in Idaho (including cities of Boise, Eagle, Caldwell, 
            Kuna, Meridian and Nampa) between August 28 to September 15, 2018. Online 
            survey was emailed to 8,768 Boise State University students, faculty and 
            employees, of which 1,623 completed the survey between September 25 to 
            October 16. This data set, at least for the in-person section, 
            is unique as a portion of the target population in this study would not 
            participate in any online survey. Wildfire smoke presents a growing threat
            in the Western U.S.; and human health, transportation, and economic systems
            in growing western communities suffer due to increasingly severe and 
            widespread fires. While modelling wildfire activity and associated wildfire 
            smoke distributions have substantially improved, understanding how people 
            perceive and respond to emerging smoke hazards has received little attention.
            Understanding and incorporating human perceptions of threats from wildfire 
            smoke is critical as decision-makers need such information to mitigate 
            smoke-related hazards. We conducted our survey among 614 randomly selected people across 
            the Boise Metropolitan Area in Idaho and gathered similar information in 
            online format from 1,623 Boise State University affiliates about their level
            of outside activity during smoke event(s), source of air quality information
            and effective messaging preference, perception of wildfire smoke as a hazard,
            and smoke-related health experiences. This relatively large dataset provides 
            a novel perspective of people’s perception of smoke hazards, and provides 
            crucial policy-relevant information to decision-makers. Dataset is available
            to the public and can be used to address a wide range of research questions.</abstract>

            The study is being conducted by Mojtaba Sadegh, assistant professor, and 
            Mariah Fowler, graduate student of Civil Engineering, at Boise State 
            University. The purpose of this study is strictly for research purposes. The 
            researchers are not affiliated in any way with any organization other than 
            Boise State University. The purpose of this study is to assess human response
            to wildfire smoke. During the study, you will answer some survey questions and
            read a brief text. This survey should take you less than 10 minutes to 
            complete. You must be at least 18 years old to complete this survey. This 
            study involves no foreseeable risks. You may discontinue the study at any 
            time. Your responses are completely anonymous and cannot be linked to you in
            any way. For this research project, we are requesting demographic information.
            Though it is unlikely, it is possible that the combined answers to these 
            questions may make an individual person identifiable. The researchers will 
            make every effort to protect your confidentiality. However, if you are 
            uncomfortable answering any of these questions, you may leave them blank.

				An online version of the questionnaire were sent to a randomly selected subset (5,020) of Boise State 
                students as well as all faculty and staff (3,748) through Qualtrics experience management service. The 
                first email was sent on September 25th, 2018, followed by two reminder emails to those who didn’t respond 
                in the first round on October 1st and October 3rd, 2018. A total of 1,623 completed responses were collected
                between September 25th, 2018 and October 16th, 2018. Figure 3f provides more details on the faculty, staff 
                and student distribution of online participants.
