## Abstract

We are concerned with how community members currently protect themselves from hazardous health conditions caused by wildfires. Answering this question can not only suggest to urban planners methods to keep their residents safe, but it can also encourage these residents to be more conscious of the negative effects of wildfires. We will address this concern by examining three data sets on recent trends of wildfire intensities, how college students perceive and navigate poor air quality from smoke, and the safest locations within buildings during wildfire seasons.

## Key Words

Wildfire, community development, air quality, building safety

## Introduction

## Problem Domain

## Research Questions

1. Does the general health of a survey participant affect their consciousness of the negative health effects of wildfires? This is a question to expose possible disparities between the health concerns of a generally healthy individual versus a generally unhealthy individual. Knowledge of this encourages building planners to consider the accessibility of the shelters available.
2. Does the geographic location of a survey participant affect their perception of wildfires? This question explores how an individualâ€™s analysis of perceived danger correlates to their daily surroundings. Data analysts must be aware that a survey respondent answers in the context of their daily life, so answers are affected by intersectionality.
3. Which rooms do people imagine to be the safest during an increase in air pollutants due to wildfire smoke? This question is crucial to understanding possible reasons for taking shelter in certain areas, and this more clearly defines the meaning of safety as the mix between emotional and physical safety.
4. Which rooms have the best measured air quality during an increase in wildfire smoke? This question allows for a comparison between perceived safety and scientific safety, as measured by the amount of pollutants in the air. Building planners can use this data to create spaces that both protect against pollutants and are an inviting environment.

## The Data Set

## Expected Implications

## Limitations

Our data set surveys students in college, so our data analysis is not representative of the general public such as the elderly, children, and those in poverty. This narrows the scope of our study and reduces applicability to other urban buildings. Additionally, the building air quality data and the survey data we will use are based on university campuses in California, so our findings may only be applicable to a culture, environment, and buildings similar to those of California and its annual wildfires. We may address these limitations by adjusting our research question to also question community safety in California. However, this adjustment excludes possible implications for the increasing wildfires in the Pacific Northwest such as Washington, Idaho, and Southwestern Canada. By including implications for the Pacific Northwest, we hope to encourage the development of data sets that also contain survey results and building safety in locations outside of California.
