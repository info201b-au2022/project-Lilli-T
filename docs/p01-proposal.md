## Abstract

In this project, we aim to thoroughly examine datasets on wildfire’s negative impact on participants’ physical health and the correlation between their health condition and personal cautiousness with the declining air quality. We will educate ourselves by analyzing three datasets and providing an in-depth report on our research questions regarding wildfire and physical well being.

## Key Words

Wildfire, community development, air quality, building safety

## Introduction
As climate change continues to affect our ecosystems, [the rate and intensity of annual wildfires have increased in the Pacific Northwest.](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires) We are concerned with how community members currently protect themselves from hazardous health conditions caused by wildfires. Answering this question can not only suggest to urban planners methods to keep their residents safe, but it can also encourage these residents to be more conscious of the negative effects of wildfires. We will address this concern by examining three data sets on recent trends of wildfire intensities, how college students perceive and navigate poor air quality from smoke, and the safest locations within buildings during wildfire seasons.

## Problem Domain
Background:Wildfires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that will continue to warm the planet well into the future. [They damage forests that would otherwise remove CO2 from the air. And they inject soot and other aerosols into the atmosphere, with complex effects on warming and cooling](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23082018/extreme-wildfires-climate-change-global-warming-air-pollution-fire-management-black-carbon-co2/).The air pollution can cause a range of health issues such as respiratory problems. Even in healthy people, [exposures to fine particles can potentially lead to transient reductions in lung function, and pulmonary inflammation.](URL)
Relevance: Wildfires and volcanic activities affected [6.2 million people between 1998-2017 with 2400 attributable deaths worldwide from suffocation, injuries, and burns](https://www.who.int/health-topics/wildfires#tab=tab_1), but the size and frequency of wildfires are increasing due to climate change.
Human values: by examining people's perception and consciousness of wildfires, we care that everyone is qualified to have access to and understand relevant knowledge about health effects.
Indirect Stakeholders: Policy makers are indirect stakeholders since they can get access to recent development of wildfires and people’s responses about it. If people take wildfires less seriously than expected, they can efficiently take action such as increasing awareness of the dangers by advocacy.  
Direct Stakeholders: Our project team is one of the direct stakeholders as our project success depends on our decisions and contributions.
Potential Benefits and Harms: The potential benefits of our project is to provide motivations and inspirations for engineers and architects to construct safer buildings in areas prone to wildfires. The potential harm is that the analysis might induce anxiety in some readers because natural disasters like wildfires are uncontrollable events which happen yearly, and corresponding building reconstructions require substantial capital investment and design dedication.


## Research Questions

1. Does the general health of a survey participant affect their consciousness of the negative health effects of wildfires? This is a question to expose possible disparities between the health concerns of a generally healthy individual versus a generally unhealthy individual. Knowledge of this encourages building planners to consider the accessibility of the shelters available.
2. Does the geographic location of a survey participant affect their perception of wildfires? This question explores how an individual’s analysis of perceived danger correlates to their daily surroundings. Data analysts must be aware that a survey respondent answers in the context of their daily life, so answers are affected by intersectionality.
3. Which rooms do people imagine to be the safest during an increase in air pollutants due to wildfire smoke? This question is crucial to understanding possible reasons for taking shelter in certain areas, and this more clearly defines the meaning of safety as the mix between emotional and physical safety.
4. Which rooms have the best measured air quality during an increase in wildfire smoke? This question allows for a comparison between perceived safety and scientific safety, as measured by the amount of pollutants in the air. Building planners can use this data to create spaces that both protect against pollutants and are an inviting environment.

## The Data Set
Our data set is a collection of

Our second file contains

Our third file contains survey results that record behavior in response to the 2018 summer California wildfires.

## Expected Implications
Architects; maybe implement ways to have a space that limits smoke and is accessible to people of lower general health.
This will all be more relevant in the future, as wildfires rates are expected to increase.

## Limitations

Our data set surveys students in college, so our data analysis is not representative of the general public such as the elderly, children, and those in poverty. This narrows the scope of our study and reduces applicability to other urban buildings. Additionally, the building air quality data and the survey data we will use are based on university campuses in California, so our findings may only be applicable to a culture, environment, and buildings similar to those of California and its annual wildfires. We may address these limitations by adjusting our research question to also question community safety in California. However, this adjustment excludes possible implications for the increasing wildfires in the Pacific Northwest such as Washington, Idaho, and Southwestern Canada. By including implications for the Pacific Northwest, we hope to encourage the development of data sets that also contain survey results and building safety in locations outside of California.
